## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

mydat_small_val_log=read.csv('pollinator_visitation_fullData_log.csv')

iplotCorr(mydat_small_val_log[,1:12],mydat_small_val_log$Visits, reorder=TRUE,
          chartOpts=list(cortitle="Correlation matrix",
                         scattitle="Scatterplot | Visits",
                         scatcolors=c("red","#00BFFF")
          ))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
